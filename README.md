# Cycling App (Built with Android Studio(Java) and Firebase(FireStore))

**The Gobike app aims to support cyclists to search suitable cycling paths and other partners to exercise together. The app serves two main purposes: The first purpose is to allow users to find cycling paths that match their preferences. The location of the cycling paths will be provided to the user. The second purpose is to create social events for the cyclers to meet new people and join other cyclers. Details of the events such as the number of members and the gathering spot will be provided to the users.**
